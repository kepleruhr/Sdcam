A complete image of a ready to go Raspi can be downloaded - dont't yet know when. It contains an OS with all necessary uploads, file structures, a ramdisk, and a startup procedure for automatically entering into full operation.

By using this image you:
* can make your SD-card,
* have to adjust your parameter/info to the .cfg files,
* enter your SSID/password (WLAN), and finaly
* reboot and let the Raspi do the rest.
